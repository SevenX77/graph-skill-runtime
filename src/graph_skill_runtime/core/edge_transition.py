"""The transition segment between one phase execution and the next.

A langgraph edge is routing, not an executable unit, so the engine has no
object standing for "what happens between two nodes". Everything that does
happen there — blackboard reduction, input dispatch, input-file injection —
used to be emitted from the head of the downstream node's wrapper and was
therefore parented to whichever phase happened to be current, which is why
``BlackboardReduceEvent.from_phase`` could only ever be ``None``.

This module owns that stretch as a first-class run segment, peer to a phase
segment: it opens, it closes, it has an identity, and it names both ends.
Authoritative design: docs/design/2026-08-15-edge-as-first-class-run-segment-decision.md

It sits below both the assembler (which opens transitions) and the state
mapper (which records a phase execution's identity for the transitions
leaving it), so neither has to import the other.
