"""What a compiled graph can produce, and what it declares as its output.

A skill answers two questions at its boundary: what it takes in, and what it
gives back. The second one was only ever derived inside the Studio frontend, so
nothing else — no tool, no check, no other surface — could reason about a
skill's output contract. It is a fact about the graph, not about a panel, so it
is derived here, once, from the compiled skill.
