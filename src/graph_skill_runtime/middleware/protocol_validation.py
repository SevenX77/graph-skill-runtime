"""ProtocolValidationMiddleware — single owner of state-contract checks.

MVP-3 T7 (B3 middleware simplification): the canonical site where the
framework verifies its three state invariants on every LLM step
boundary. Replaces the contract-validation slice that previously sat
inside the legacy ``cognitive/middlewares.py`` parallel pipeline (which
mixed contract validation with finish_task interception, schema
hoisting, and rejection-message authoring). Phase 3 M7 retired the
legacy pipeline; this middleware now owns contract checks exclusively.

Three contracts pinned here:

1. ``state['data']`` (BusinessData, ``extra='allow'``) must not contain
   any ``_``-prefixed keys. The MVP-1 namespace split puts framework
   metadata in ``state['flow']``; a stray ``_x`` in BusinessData means
   either a tool wrote to the wrong namespace or a regression sneaked
   in via SKILL.md authoring.
2. ``state['flow']`` (FrameworkState, ``extra='forbid'``) must round
   trip through ``FrameworkState.model_validate``. The Pydantic forbid
   check is enforced on construction, but a tool that mutates the
   in-memory dataclass via ``__dict__`` (an old hack) bypasses it.
   Re-validating at every LLM step boundary catches the divergence.
3. ``schema_engine.validate(state['data'].model_dump(),
   current_phase_schema)`` must succeed when the phase has a compiled
   schema. The schema describes what the LLM is about to produce; an
   inconsistent BusinessData here means the previous turn drifted
   (e.g., a tool returned dict keys that don't match output_schema).

Each ``before_model`` / ``after_model`` call returns ``None`` (a no-op
LangGraph state update) when invariants hold. A failure raises
:class:`ProtocolValidationError`; the surrounding agent loop converts
that into a tool rejection or run-level crash, depending on context.
The middleware deliberately does *not* attempt to recover the state —
the framework's contract is binary, and silent recovery would mask
authoring bugs.
