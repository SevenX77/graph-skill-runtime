"""Guarantee protocol-legal tool history on every outgoing model request.

OpenAI-protocol providers reject any history where an assistant message with
tool_calls is not followed by tool messages answering each tool_call_id
(HTTP 400 "insufficient tool messages following tool_calls message"). Several
inner-loop paths can legally jump back to the model while the latest
AI(tool_calls) is still unanswered — e.g. CognitiveFlow's finish_task
rejection Command(goto="model") racing a parallel second call, or
ExitControl's after_agent nudge. The model boundary is the single exit where
the provider contract must hold, so the repair lives here: any orphaned
tool_call gets a synthetic ToolMessage before the request leaves the engine.
