"""Deliver an AGENT phase's runtime inputs to the model.

The v0.3.0 assembler bakes the cognitive-template system prompt at assembly
time, so ``{key}`` placeholders authored in role/goal/steps stay literal and
the dispatched phase inputs never reach the model at all (field evidence: a
request containing exactly one static SystemMessage). This middleware closes
that gap per model call:

- renders ``{key}`` placeholders in the system message against the blackboard
  view (same context the legacy prompt path used);
- delivers the phase's declared inputs as a JSON block, on every model call.

Delivery is per call because this is a ``wrap_model_call`` middleware: the block
is handed to the model but never written back to state. ``ModelRequest.messages``
is rebuilt from ``state["messages"]`` on every model node entry, and only the
model's own output is merged back. So each turn starts without the block and
must be given it again.

The criterion for "does this request already have it" is the block's own
content. It used to be "does the history hold ANY HumanMessage", which is a
proxy for the wrong thing: nudges, dead-end warnings and loop diagnostics are
all HumanMessages written into the conversation by sibling middlewares, so the
first nudge a phase received silenced its own inputs for every later turn of
that phase (field evidence: run ``2026-08-15T12-40-22_bb6e358a``, where every
never-nudged phase got one delivery per model call and every nudged phase got
exactly one in total).
