"""End to end: a real run announces a tool call before it reports one.

The middleware unit tests pin the ordering against the tool body in isolation
(skill tools must be pure, so a real one cannot record that it ran). What this
proves is that the started event reaches a run's callbacks at all, and that the
identity it announces survives to whichever emitter reports the completion.

It also pins the one tool that is NOT announced — see the second test.
