"""The cognitive template is a VALUE, and rendering it did not change.

`apply_v030_cognitive_template` used to build its output from an f-string body,
which meant the un-substituted template existed only as source code — nothing
the run could report. A prompt reader therefore could not tell "the model was
told this because the template says so" from "because the phase author wrote
it", which is the very distinction the template id was introduced for
(`V030_COGNITIVE_TEMPLATE_ID`'s docstring).

Extracting the body into a module constant rendered with `str.format` is a pure
refactor, and this test is what makes that claim checkable rather than asserted:
`v030_cognitive_template.golden.md` was rendered BY THE F-STRING IMPLEMENTATION
(recovered from git) with the arguments below, and the two outputs were equal
byte for byte. A future edit that shifts a single space in the boilerplate has
to say so by updating the golden.
