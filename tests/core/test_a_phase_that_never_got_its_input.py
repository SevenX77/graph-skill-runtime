"""A phase that dies on its own input contract still reports that it ran.

E17 made a phase execution state how it ended. That fix only reaches executions
that *opened*, and one branch never opened: when a field the phase declares as a
required input is absent from the blackboard, the run dies with
``[F-v3-runtime-state-mapping-failed]`` and the phase emits nothing at all —
no ``phase_start``, no ``phase_end``. The node that killed the run draws as idle
on the canvas and has no row in the run report's Nodes table (ledger E18).

Two causes, both fixed here:

1. ``StateMapper`` fused two jobs into ``build_phase_input`` — projecting the
   blackboard down to this phase's declared inputs, and enforcing that the
   required ones are present. ``_emit_input_dispatch`` wants only the
   projection, but called the fused method, so the *reporting* path was what
   raised, before any lifecycle existed. They are now ``select_declared_inputs``
   and ``require_declared_inputs``.
2. The required-input check ran before the execution was announced. It is the
   phase's first step, not a precondition of the phase existing — the mirror of
   OB13's argument for the output validator being the phase's last step. It now
   runs after ``opened``.
