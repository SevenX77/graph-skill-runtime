"""LOGIC `actions/*.py` may hold private helpers; only DECLARED names are actions.

Observable defect (2026-08-16, compiling `D:/coding/skills/story-deconstruction-v3-lab`)::

    action '_addressable_units' must accept exactly one inputs parameter
    action '_entity_ids' must accept exactly one inputs parameter

Neither name appears in its phase's `LOGIC.md` `actions:` list, and neither is
ever dispatched. The engine still called both "an action" and enforced the
action signature on them.

Cause (`src/graph_skill_runtime/core/loader.py`):

- `:1419-1429` `_load_action_dir` iterates `_module_functions(module)` and
  registers/validates EVERY module-level function found in the file.
- `:1494-1499` `_module_functions` returns all functions defined in the module,
  private `_`-prefixed ones included.
- `:1502-1519` `_validate_action_signature` then emits
  `[F-v3-logic-action-entrypoint-missing]` with the message
  ``action '<name>' must accept exactly one inputs parameter``.

Why that is wrong — dispatch is declaration-driven, never file-driven:

- `graph_assembler.py:1560` ``action_names = phase_ast.actions`` and `:1566-1567`
  ``for action_name in action_names: compiled.actions.resolve(phase_id, action_name)``
  is the ONLY execution entry. A function absent from `actions:` can never run.
- `loader.py:2802-2809` `_validate_logic_actions_declared` additionally pins the
  frontmatter list to the body `<action>` order, so the declaration is exact.

Design source — `docs/skill-spec/00-FORMAT-GROUND-TRUTH.md` §3, the
format SSOT that `docs/mvp1/01-contract/02-skill-syntax/mvp1-alignment.md:26-30`
defers to:

    | `actions` | yes | list[string] | action 名注册表 |
    LOGIC action 源文件位于 `phases/<phase_id>/actions/<action_name>.py`。
    文件必须导出同名函数，签名严格为 `def <action_name>(inputs) -> dict`。

The signature rule is scoped to `<action_name>` — the declared name. Nothing in
the design says the `actions/` module is a flat namespace holding only actions.

Purity stays file-wide by design:
`docs/mvp1/01-contract/03-compile-rules/mvp1-alignment.md:79` scopes it to
the "action/tool Python 文件" — the FILE, not the function — so a helper's
impurity must still be a compile FATAL.
