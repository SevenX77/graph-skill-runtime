"""A phase with several `depends_on` predecessors must wait for ALL of them.

Decision doc: .kiro/specs/decision-2026-08-15-engine-multi-dep-join-waits-for-all.md

The assembler used to translate `depends_on="a,b"` into two independent edges,
one per predecessor. In LangGraph a plain edge is a trigger, not a barrier: the
target fires as soon as ANY subscribed predecessor commits. That is invisible
while every predecessor happens to finish in the same superstep — the usual
fan-out/fan-in diamond — and wrong the moment the branches have different
depths. Then the join runs early against a blackboard that is missing the deep
branch's output, and runs a SECOND time when that branch finally lands.
