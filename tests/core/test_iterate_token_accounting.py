"""What an iterated phase spent is part of what the run spent.

Field evidence (2026-08-19). Run ``2026-08-19T05-21-45``'s ``trace.jsonl`` holds
84 LLM calls totalling 687613 input / 98592 output tokens, while the same run
directory's ``metrics.json`` reports 0/0/0. In run
``2026-08-19T06-22``'s metadata the reported 147414/21323 is exactly the sum of
the only three phases in the whole graph that are NOT under an ``iterate`` — so
the loss is not a rounding error or a reporting bug downstream, it is every
call made inside an iterated phase.

Why it happens, and why it is structural rather than a missed line. A batch item
and a loop round run the phase node against a CHILD state, and that child state
is then discarded in favour of a channel delta built by
``_phase_outputs_delta``. Everything the child recorded that the delta does not
carry is gone — the same loss ``phase_execution_ids`` was already threaded out
by hand to avoid. Token spend was never threaded out.

The first fix (2026-08-19) kept the count in graph state and gave each child a
ZEROED base, so siblings reported increments that could be added. It made these
two fixtures pass and left the same premise standing, which a fan-out then broke
again (see ``test_parallel_token_accounting``). Token counting has since left
graph state altogether (OB10): a run's total is accumulated as each call reports
itself, so there is no child state for an iterate to discard the count with.

What these two fixtures pin is therefore unchanged and still worth running —
batch and loop really do run their phase against a child state, and the
invariant below says the run's total covers those calls anyway.
