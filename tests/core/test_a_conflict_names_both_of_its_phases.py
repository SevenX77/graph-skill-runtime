"""A two-phase conflict has to name both phases in fields, not only in prose.

``_validate_sequential_overwrites`` knows exactly which field collides and
which upstream phase wrote it first — both are local variables at the moment it
raises. Only the English sentence carried them out: ``field_path`` was filled
with ``allow_sequential_overwrite``, the frontmatter key that FIXES the
conflict, and the upstream phase had no slot at all.

So the one consumer that reads the structured axes reads the wrong thing. The
canvas popover takes ``CompileError.field`` as the overwritten field name and
would render "Field ``allow_sequential_overwrite`` is also output by upstream
node …" — and the allow-list check it drives (`currentFileAllowsSequentialOverwrite`)
asks whether ``allow_sequential_overwrite`` lists itself, which is never true,
so the warning could never clear. Everything else about the conflict reached
the UI by regexing the sentence (ledger K3).

``_validate_parallel_writes`` — same file, same "one field, two writers"
family — already points ``field_path`` at ``io.outputs.properties.<key>``. This
aligns its sibling rule to that convention and gives the second participant a
field of its own.
