"""A phase execution ends by saying how it ended, not merely that it did.

Field evidence (2026-08-20, run ``2026-08-20T15-44-03_98726d7c``): a run that
died on ``[F-v3-agent-validator-failed]`` left a trace in which nothing said the
phase had failed — the finish_task verdict was ``accepted``, the exit decision
was ``exit_success``, and ``phase_end`` carried no outcome at all. The only
failure signal was the run-level ``run_ended status=crashed``. Both readers took
the phase at its word: the canvas drew the node that died as **Success**, and
the run report's Nodes table gave it **ok** (ledger E17).

The reader is not the problem. ``run-status-projection.ts`` already believes any
event that states its own outcome, and the report already groups by execution —
neither was told. What was missing is the producer saying it.

Two things this pins:

1. ``phase_end`` states the outcome, so "a phase ended without saying how" stops
   being representable.
2. The outcome covers the phase's whole execution, validator included. The
   validator checks the phase's declared output contract, which is part of doing
   the phase, not something that happens after it — so a phase whose output is
   rejected must not report ``completed`` and then let the run die elsewhere.
