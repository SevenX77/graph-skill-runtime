"""A cached compile must not answer for a tree that is not the one on disk.

`compute_cache_key` walked `GRAPH.md` plus `phases/**/*.md` only. A skill with
nested subgraphs keeps most of its phases under `subgraph/**`, and every
validator / logic action is a `.py`. Those files ARE compile inputs — breaking
one changes the diagnostics — but they were outside the key, so `compile_skill`
served the previous tree's result and reported a clean compile for a broken
skill.

Direction of the error matters: an over-broad input set only costs an extra
recompile, while a too-narrow one produces a wrong answer. Build caches that
get this right (ccache, Bazel) all treat an unsound dependency set as a
correctness bug, not a tuning knob.

Measured on 2026-08-15 with `story-deconstruction-v3-lab`: 5 of its 133 `.md`
files and 0 of its 27 `.py` files were in the key. Breaking a subgraph phase
returned `issues=0`; bumping the root `GRAPH.md` mtime with the SAME broken
content returned 7 issues.
