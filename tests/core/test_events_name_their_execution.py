"""An event says which phase execution it happened in, instead of a reader guessing.

Field evidence (2026-08-20, run ``2026-08-20T13-14-59_14582c6b``). ``LLMCallEvent``
carries ``phase_name`` but no execution id, so the run report charges a call to
"whichever execution of this node is open right now" and says so in its own
comment (``apps/studio/backend/app/services/run_report.py``: "an ``llm_call``
carries no execution id of its own, and the trace is ordered"). That premise
fails under a fan-out: in that run ``aggregate``, ``extrac`` and ``settings``
each had two executions open at the same time, and 4 of the 63 calls landed in
those windows, charged to whichever execution happened to have opened last.

This is the same wrong premise as OB10 one level down. There the run's total was
rebuilt from surviving state instead of counted at the call; here a call's owner
is rebuilt from position instead of stated by the producer. Both make a reader
reconstruct something the emitter already knew.

The scope already exists — ``wrap_edge_transition`` mints the destination
execution id and holds it for the whole phase body, which is how
``PhaseStartEvent`` gets it. So the fix is to stamp it in the one place every
event already passes through, exactly as ``subgraph_path`` is stamped, rather
than adding an argument to each emitter and hoping nobody forgets one.
