"""Every model request must answer every prior tool_call_id in its history.

OpenAI-protocol providers hard-reject a history where an assistant message
carrying tool_calls is not followed by tool messages responding to each id
(field evidence: run 2026-08-01T09-10-21, DeepSeek 400 "insufficient tool
messages following tool_calls message"). The engine's reject→nudge loop builds
exactly that shape: after CognitiveFlow rejects a finish_task submission,
ExitControl nudges the graph back to the model with the trailing AI(tool_calls)
left unanswered in the outgoing request.
