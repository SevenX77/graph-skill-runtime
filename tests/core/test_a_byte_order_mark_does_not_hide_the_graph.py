"""A UTF-8 byte-order mark is encoding, not content.

Measured first (2026-08-21, ledger K7): `D:/coding/skills/text-segmentation-v2-lab`
had a GRAPH.md whose first three bytes are `EF BB BF`. Studio drew the two
boundary nodes and nothing else — every phase gone, no error anywhere. The
frontmatter matcher is anchored (`^---`) and the BOM decodes to a `\\ufeff`
character sitting in front of it, so the document read as having no frontmatter
at all, and `phases` came back empty.

Windows editors write that mark routinely (Notepad, PowerShell redirection), so
a skill authored outside Studio arrives with it. The engine already tolerated it
on ONE read path — `graph_assembler` stripped it from runtime input files with a
call-site `.lstrip("\\ufeff")` — which is the tell: one question, two answers.
