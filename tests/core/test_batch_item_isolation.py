"""A batch item is an execution scope of its own, not a turn in a shared conversation.

Field evidence (run 2026-08-15T10-19-55_df555c19, skill story-deconstruction-v3-lab).
The `segmentation` subgraph iterates over 2 chapters. Item 1's `segment` phase burned
8 iterations and died; item 2's `segment` then started at iteration **9**, inherited an
already-spent nudge budget, and — while holding item 2's inputs (`chapter_number: 2`,
chapter 2's text) — recorded item 1's answer as its output:

    ctx.phase_outputs.segment.parsed_segments[0].description =
      "主角在现实世界中与张超会合、驱车前往露营地…" ← chapter ONE's story

Downstream `review` consumed that as chapter 2's summary. Nothing went red.

Root cause: `_phase_batch_runner` invokes each item through `_run_with_branch_index_async`,
which sets only the branch-index contextvar used for event labelling. Its graph-level twin
`_graph_batch_runner` uses `_run_with_iteration_context_async`, which also sets
`active_outer_ns` — the value `NamespaceCheckpointer._wrap_config` needs to give each item
its own checkpoint lane. Without it every item presents the agent graph the same
`(thread_id, checkpoint_ns)` pair, so item 2's `agent_graph.invoke` resumes item 1's
checkpoint (its whole message history) and `ExitControlMiddleware`, whose budget dicts are
keyed by that same pair, hands item 2 item 1's spent budget.

Both symptoms are asserted here because they fail independently: with a generous
`max_iterations` the history bleed is SILENT and the run reports success.
