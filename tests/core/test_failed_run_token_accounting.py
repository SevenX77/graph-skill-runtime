"""A run that died still spent what it spent.

Field evidence (2026-08-20, offline). A phase whose submissions never satisfy
its schema exhausts ``max_iterations`` and the run dies with
``[F-v3-agent-exit-control-failed]``. Its ``trace.jsonl`` holds 5 ``llm_call``
events worth 55/35 tokens — those calls were made, billed, and written down —
while ``result.metrics`` reports ``0/0/0``.

Why. ``run_skill``'s ``except GraphAgentError`` branch built a fresh
``WorkflowMetrics(wall_time_sec=...)`` because it had nothing else to build one
from: the run's spend ledger was created deeper in, inside
``_run_portable_skill_dict``, and an exception unwinds past it. So the exit that
reports a failure could not see what the failure cost, and every failed run
looked free.

The fix is an ownership one rather than a patch at the ``except``: the run's
event sink is per-run, its trace file lives in the run directory, and both exits
have to read the same ledger — so ``run_skill`` / ``resume_skill`` create it and
hand it down, instead of the inner function creating one that only the success
path can reach. Same discipline the run id already follows: decided once,
before anything can fail, so every exit reports the same values.
