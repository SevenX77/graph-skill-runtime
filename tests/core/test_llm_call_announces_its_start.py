"""An LLM call says it is starting, and it says so from the call site.

A round-trip is the slowest thing in a run — minutes, against milliseconds for
everything around it. Announcing it only on the way out means the panel watching
the run has nothing to show for the whole time it matters.

The announcement used to be made by a proxy wrapped around the chat model, which
only worked for a caller that invoked the model directly. An AGENT phase hands
its model to ``create_agent`` and LangChain drives it through ``_generate``
instead, so that entire path — where the long work happens — announced nothing.
These tests pin the announcement to the one place both paths pass through: the
call itself.
