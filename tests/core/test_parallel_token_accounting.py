"""What the branches of a fan-out spent is part of what the run spent.

Field evidence (2026-08-20). Run ``2026-08-20T11-30-38_df572662`` — made on a
vendor snapshot that already carried the iterate fix — reports
``626900/114065/740965`` in its ``report.md`` and ``474586/96642/571228`` in the
same directory's ``metrics.json``: 169737 tokens, 22.9%, missing from one of two
numbers shown on the same screen. The skill's heaviest node fans out seven ways.

Why it happened, and why it was structural. Every phase used to write its spend
into the ``flow`` channel as "the total I inherited plus what I spent". Under a
fan-out, N phases write that channel in one superstep, and ``flow``'s dict
fields are merged PER KEY — which loses nothing when branches touch different
keys (each phase writes its own name into ``phase_execution_ids``) but degrades
to last-writer-wins when they all write the same two token keys. One branch's
total became the run's total.

This is the second shape of one wrong premise, not a relapse of the first. The
iterate fix (2026-08-19) gave each child a zeroed base so siblings' increments
could be added; a value that carries an inherited base can only ever be merged
by overwriting it or by double-counting the base, and there is no third option.
So token counting left graph state entirely (OB10): a run's total is now
accumulated as each call reports itself, where no channel can drop it.
