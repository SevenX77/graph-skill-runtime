"""LLMProviderChatModel must not smuggle engine callbacks through LangChain's
reserved ``callbacks`` field.

``BaseChatModel`` already owns ``callbacks`` (list[BaseCallbackHandler] |
BaseCallbackManager | None); shadowing it with a tuple of graph_skill_runtime Callback
objects makes every ``.invoke()`` crash inside LangChain's
``CallbackManager.configure`` (``'tuple' object has no attribute 'handlers'``)
— first real LLM call of any run died this way. Engine callbacks ride their own
field (``event_callbacks``), the same convention PredictGatewayChatModel uses.
