"""A defect found inside a child skill reaches the parent with every axis intact.

A subgraph phase compiles its child skill, and when that child fails, the parent
catches the error and re-raises the child's diagnostics as its own. That seam
rebuilt each diagnostic field by field, so an axis nobody remembered to list
there simply did not exist any more once the parent reported it.

`conflicting_phase` is the one that proved it. It was added so the sequential-
overwrite rule could name the OTHER phase structurally instead of only inside
its English sentence (ledger K3), and it worked — at the top level. One subgraph
deep the field arrived `None`, and the canvas was back to reading the sentence.

`source_path` is the axis that must be REBUILT rather than carried: it is
relative to whichever root stated it, so the child's own relative path has to be
re-rooted before the parent renders it against its own root. That distinction —
one axis re-derived, all others carried — is what these tests pin.
