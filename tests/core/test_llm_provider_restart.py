"""A retried answer replaces the one before it; folding must agree.

A provider is not the only thing that can decide to answer again. The host
behind the Port retries too — a bigger budget after an answer was cut off, a
different route after one failed — and each retry produces a *different*
answer rather than more of the same one. The slices of the abandoned attempt
are therefore not part of the answer, and whoever folds slices back together
has to be told so explicitly.

Without that, the fold silently concatenates two attempts and hands the agent
loop a message no model ever wrote.
