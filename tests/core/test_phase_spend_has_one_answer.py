"""What a phase spent is answered by the calls it made, and only by those.

``PhaseEndEvent`` declared ``metrics: dict[str, Any]`` and the one place that
constructs it (``graph_assembler``) never passed the argument, so the field was
``{}`` on every emission ever made. Measured on the real app, run
``2026-08-20T13-14-59_14582c6b``: 42 ``phase_end`` events, 42 of them empty —
including phases that really did call a model four times.

A declared field that nothing fills is not a gap to be filled later; it is a
contract that lies. A reader cannot tell "this phase spent nothing" from "nobody
set this", and the type says the first.

Filling it would have been the worse of the two repairs. Per-phase spend already
has an answer: the ``llm_call`` events the phase made, which is what the run
report sums into its per-node ``tokens in/out`` column
(``apps/studio/backend/app/services/run_report.py``). Adding a second place that
answers the same question is the shape OB10 removed from run totals a day
earlier, and it would come back one level down. So the field is deleted, and the
rule it should have expressed is pinned here instead.

(Which EXECUTION of a phase a call belongs to is a different question, and the
events do not answer it yet — see ledger row E15.)
