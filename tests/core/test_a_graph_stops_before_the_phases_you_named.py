"""A graph can be told which phases to stop before, and continue past them.

Design: run-execution/mvp1-alignment.md F10 + RUN_EXECUTION-16. The stop is
LangGraph's compile-time ``interrupt_before`` rather than a check inside each
phase: a breakpoint is an outside observation, and one that each phase had to
consult would change the code path of the thing being observed.
