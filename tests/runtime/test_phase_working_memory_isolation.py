"""A phase plans for itself: ``flow.working_memory`` is phase-local on input.

Companion to ``test_phase_conversation_isolation.py``. That one closed the
``messages`` inlet (decision
``.kiro/specs/decision-2026-08-16-a-phase-opens-its-own-conversation.md``);
its leftover #2 named ``flow.working_memory`` as the second cross-phase inlet
and left the ruling open. This module pins the ruling that closed it.

The defect is visible thirty lines apart inside one class.
``ExitControlMiddleware._own_finish_payload`` (``middleware/exit_control.py``)
qualifies the framework-state marker it reads by phase name — "The framework
state carries the previous phase's marker across the boundary, so only a marker
labelled with this phase's name counts." Its neighbour
``_working_memory_has_plan`` reads a value of exactly the same cross-boundary
shape and asks only whether the key ``plan`` is present. The writer had the
phase name in hand and did not use it: ``middleware/cognitive_flow.py`` stores
the plan under the constant key ``WORKING_MEMORY_PLAN_KEY = "plan"`` in the
same statement block that emits ``WorkingMemoryUpdateEvent(phase_name=...)``.

So one upstream plan silences the planning nudge for every later phase in the
run. The consequence is narrow and worth stating precisely: a downstream phase
that only talks — text out, no tool call — should be told to record a plan
first (``PLANNING_NUDGE``) and instead gets the generic "you didn't call
finish_task" text, because the planning gate believes a plan already exists.
This is NOT a bypassed safety gate: ``nudge_policy.try_planning`` declines on
``not latest_content or has_tool_calls or has_plan``, an OR — any tool call
already stands the gate down.

What belongs in the slot is phase-local by definition: ``PLANNING_NUDGE``
(``middleware/nudge_policy.py``) asks the model to record "1. 本阶段的目标是
什么". And working memory is not the cross-phase excavation channel — its twin
is. The two tool docstrings, which are the contract the model itself reads,
divide the work: ``query_working_memory`` reads "the current working-memory
plan text recorded by update_working_memory"; ``read_artifact`` reads "an
earlier phase's named output". ``context_access`` therefore means ``artifact``
for across phases and ``working_memory`` for within one.

Write-back is untouched, exactly as in the messages ruling: this is about what
a phase is HANDED, not what the run keeps. The flow channel merges
``working_memory`` per key (``core/state.py`` ``_FLOW_DICT_MERGE_FIELDS``), so
an emptied slot travels as an empty dict and unions to a no-op, while a phase
that does record a plan overwrites only the ``plan`` key. The iterate
bookkeeping key written beside it (``iterate_executions``,
``core/graph_assembler.py``) survives both — pinned below, because an isolation
that silently ate that key would be a regression traded for a fix.
