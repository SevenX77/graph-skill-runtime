"""A phase's agent starts its own conversation, not the previous phase's.

The user ruled this directly in the nine-round finalization, Round 8 item 3:

    3. phase 间默认强隔离（`messages = []` by-design）+ 按需挖掘机制（context_access opt-in）
    -- docs.backup-2026-05-20/archive/superpowers_history/
       2026-04-27-prompt-schema-9round-final-plan.md:79

and the current migration decision re-states it as binding
(`docs/design/2026-08-15-legacy-cognitive-features-migration-decision.md:184`:
"opt-in 语义是用户裁定的,必须原样保留"). Live code cites the same ruling —
`_cognitive_framework_tools` in `core/graph_assembler.py` says "the context-access
readers stay opt-in behind the phase's ``context_access`` declaration (Round 8:
strong isolation by default)" — and implements only the opt-in half. The default
half was never wired: `StateMapper.select_declared_inputs` handed every phase the
global `WorkflowState.messages` list.

That is not merely wasteful. Measured on run `2026-08-15T12-40-22_bb6e358a` of
`story-deconstruction-v3-lab`, the `continuity` phase opened with 61 messages of
which 60 belonged to other phases, and one of the inherited HumanMessages read
"工具 `finish_task` 在 phase `foreshadow` 中连续重复执行了 3 次" — a loop
diagnostic about a *different* phase, delivered as if it were an instruction to
this one. In the same run the `foreshadow` and `prop` phases opened on
`entity_and_characters`' finished conversation and submitted that phase's output
fields, which `finish_task` rejected as `Extra inputs are not permitted`.

A second, quieter effect rides along. The middleware that seeds a phase's
declared inputs as a JSON block fires only when the history holds NO HumanMessage
at all (`middleware/runtime_input.py:64`), and every nudge, dead-end warning and
loop diagnostic is written into the shared channel as a HumanMessage
(`middleware/exit_control.py:209,306,327`, `middleware/execution_control.py:271`,
`middleware/loop_detection.py:134`). So one nudge anywhere stops that block from
ever being delivered again — 38 `runtime_input_injected` events across 42 phase
executions in that run, with `continuity` and `settings` getting none. This is
not the same as a phase running blind: the authored system prompt interpolates
`{field}` placeholders itself, and continuity's did carry its data. What is lost
is the engine's own structured copy of the declared inputs.

Three more middlewares scan the whole history and so read another phase's
traffic as this one's: LoopDetection's five-message window, ExecutionControl's
dead-end scan, and Compaction's token count.

The global channel keeps accumulating every phase's messages, so trace,
checkpoint and HITL resume are untouched — only what a phase is *handed* changes.
