"""A phase that loops because the plan says to is not a phase that is stuck.

Predict guards against its own stand-in data trapping routing: feed every agent
node the same output every time and a route that branches on that output keeps
choosing the same edge, so predict would spin where a real run would move on.
The guard counted how often each phase NAME appeared and called anything over
ten a deadlock.

But a phase repeats for two unrelated reasons. `iterate` repeats it on purpose,
once per item, and the item list is resolved before the loop starts
(`graph_assembler._run_graph_loop_iterate`) — finite, planned, and about to end.
Routing coming back to a phase is the other one, and only that one is a trap.
Counting names alone cannot tell them apart, and it did not: a plain loop over
eleven items — a LOGIC phase running a two-line Python action, no model and no
stub anywhere near it — died with `PredictDeadlockError` (ledger K5).

The archived predict-v2 design saw this coming and wrote the mitigation down:
"合法循环 vs 死锁误判:合理的多次循环被强杀。缓解:…该防护仅在 P2 模式生效"
(.kiro/specs/_archive/predict-v2/design.md:234). Scoping the guard to the stub
strategy is in the code — but a strategy belongs to the whole RUN, so it never
separated a looping phase from a stuck one. What separates them is the
iteration each execution belongs to, which is now on the phase record, so the
count is per iteration: a loop over a thousand items is a thousand groups of
one.
