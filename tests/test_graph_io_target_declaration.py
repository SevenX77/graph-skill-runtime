"""An output's `target` is an enum, and compile has to say so.

A session probing the declaration contract wrote `target: __probe_invalid__`
into GRAPH.md and compiled: `status: ok`, zero defects, and the junk value
carried straight into the manifest and io_schema (exp-b-round3, 2026-08-03).
At run time the writer only fires for `file` or `artifact`, so the run produced
no file and said nothing about why — the failure mode a user sees as
"artifacts/ is always empty".

Compile is the single exit for that kind of defect, so it belongs here rather
than in a Studio-side check; and with it in place the compiler can serve as the
contract oracle a session naturally reaches for.

It reports under the existing `[F-v3-graph-io-schema-invalid]` family rather than
a new code: the registry is frozen at 97 codes by design (R4.3 / design §6.5), and
an unknown `target` IS an invalid inline io schema — the specific value and the
legal set travel in the message and `field_path`, which is what a reader needs.
