"""Shared fixtures + import-time invariants for the graph_agent suite.

The middleware-chain topological order regression test lives in
``tests/graph_agent/middleware/test_chain_topology.py`` so pytest
collects it as part of the full suite (``conftest.py`` is treated as
a fixtures file and tests inside it do not run during a full
``pytest tests/graph_agent/`` invocation). The import below acts as
an import-time sanity check — if the middleware package fails to
import (e.g., a missing module after a refactor), every test in the
suite errors out at collection rather than producing a confusing
runtime failure deep in a single test case.

# Import-time sanity: ensure the MVP-3 middleware package is importable
# before any test runs. The actual ordering assertions live in the
