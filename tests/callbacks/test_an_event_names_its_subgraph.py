"""Every event emitted inside a subgraph names the subgraph chain it ran in.

A phase name is only unique WITHIN one skill. The composed graph runs several
skills, and two of them may both own a phase called `review` — which is not a
naming accident to fix in the skill: a subgraph is a reusable unit, and units
are allowed to have conventional internal names.

Field evidence (run 2026-08-19T01-56-15_d0733362, story-deconstruction-v3-lab):
the run report accounts nodes by bare ``phase_name``, so the `review` of the
text-segmentation subgraph and the `review` of the event-extraction subgraph
folded into ONE row (13 llm_calls), and event-extraction's `setup` vanished
into segmentation's. The events themselves carried nothing to tell them apart,
so the report could not do better (`run_report._event_node` reads phase keys
only) — the identity has to leave the engine on the event.

``_EventBase.subgraph_path`` is that identity: the dot-joined chain of
enclosing SUBGRAPH phase ids, stamped centrally in ``_safe_emit_event`` from
the scope ``_build_subgraph_node`` maintains around each child-graph invoke.
