"""The agent loop says why each turn ended — including when it ended well.

`ExitControlMiddleware.after_agent` is the gate that decides whether an agent
phase keeps going or stops. It has four answers, and until 2026-08-20 three of
them were written with `logger.info(...)` and nothing else:

    "Qualified finish_task marker observed. Exiting success."
    "Tool calls present but no valid finish marker. Jumping back to model."
    "No finish marker and no nudge condition. Jumping back to model."

Only the fourth — the nudge — reached the event stream, through `NudgeEvent`.
So the loop's most common outcome by far, a phase ending because its submission
was accepted, was invisible to every reader of a run: the trace showed a
`finish_task` call, a verdict, then `phase_end`, with nothing saying the exit
gate had agreed. Measured 2026-08-20 on a real 8-phase run
(`.workspace/runs/2026-08-19T06-58-15_179d1440/trace.jsonl`): 77 events, four
agent phases, zero events from the component that ended all four.

That is E4's "只给结果不给过程" in its most literal form. The engine already
writes these sentences — as `print`-grade log lines nobody in the product reads.

The rule this settles, so the next guard does not have to be argued case by
case: a component that DECIDES reports every decision it makes, and a guard that
only ASSERTS reports only when the assertion fails. `ExitControl` decides — the
loop continues or stops because of what it answered — so every answer is an
event now, including the planning gate on `after_model`, which redirects the
loop before `after_agent` ever runs. `ProtocolValidationMiddleware` asserts:
passing changes nothing and happens twice per model call, so it stays
failure-only.
