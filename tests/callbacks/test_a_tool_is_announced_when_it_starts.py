"""EVERY tool call is announced when it starts, and reported exactly once.

`ToolCallStartedEvent` fired only for skill-declared tools. The framework tools
— `finish_task`, `update_working_memory`, `ask_clarification`, the whole
cognitive set — were never announced, and those are most of what an agent phase
actually calls. Measured 2026-08-20 against a real `run_skill`: a phase calling
`update_working_memory` and then `finish_task` produced two `tool_call` events,
zero `tool_call_started`, and a spy on `TracingMiddleware.wrap_tool_call` /
`awrap_tool_call` counted zero dispatches of either.

The cause is ordering, not a missing emitter. `CognitiveFlowMiddleware` sat
AHEAD of `TracingMiddleware` and answers the tools it intercepts without calling
`handler(request)`, so the rest of the wrapper chain — the observer included —
was skipped for exactly those calls. An observer a decider can skip is not
observing the system; it is observing whatever subset another component's
control flow leaves for it. So tracing belongs OUTSIDE the deciders.

This replaces `e2e/test_tool_call_started_e2e.py`'s
`test_finish_task_is_not_announced_because_cognitive_flow_intercepts_it`, which
pinned the gap while stating what closing it would need: "a decision about who
owns tracing on the agent path". That decision is the ordering above.

The second test is the other half of the move. Once the observer runs it closes
the calls that answered with a `ToolMessage`, while the agent node's post-hoc
scan of the message list exists to catch the ones that answered with a `Command`
and never closed. With both live, every ToolMessage-answered call would be
reported twice — so "report this call" has to mean "unless it has already been
reported", and that memory belongs to the one reporter the phase has.
