"""A loop phase must name its execution to the transitions leaving it.

`from_phase_execution_ids` exists so a downstream transition can say WHICH
upstream execution it carries state out of (decision 2026-08-15
edge-as-first-class-run-segment, D3). A loop phase returns a channel delta
built by `_phase_outputs_delta`, which carries only `data` — so the execution
identity the state mapper records never reached the graph state, and the one
topology the plural field was designed for reported an empty list.
