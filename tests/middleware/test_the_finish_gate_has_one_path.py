"""There is one finish_task path, and these symbols are not on it.

``CognitiveFlowMiddleware`` carried a second, complete finish_task pipeline —
``handle_finish_task_tool_result`` plus the static gate
(``validate_finish_task_with_schema_gate``) and validator adapter
(``invoke_validator_with_contract``) it called. Nothing in ``src/`` called it.
Its one call site lived in the hand-rolled tool-execution loop in
``graph_assembler.py`` and went away with that loop in ``3edd12d0``
(WS-E1 step 1, the move to ``create_agent``, 2026-06-07); the handler itself was
left behind. Only tests reached it after that (ledger E19).

Two reasons this was worse than ordinary dead code:

1. It read as a live retry mechanism. ``invoke_validator_with_contract`` takes
   the *real* phase-validator signature and, on rejection, builds a ToolMessage
   telling the model to redo the work — so a reader reasonably concludes that a
   rejected phase validator sends the model back for another try. It does not,
   and it never did from here: the sole caller passed ``validator=None``
   literally, which returns accepted before the validator is ever consulted.
   Building the ledger's E16 row started from exactly this misreading.
2. Design has since ruled the other way. CG4 (cognitive alignment) puts the
   phase's business rules in its sibling ``validator.py``, run by
   ``PhaseWrapper`` after the phase body and **fatally, with no bounce back to
   the model** — and gives the reason for refusing the retry shape: one declared
   validator would otherwise have two call sites with two meanings.

Nothing was lost by deleting it. The live path — ``wrap_tool_call`` →
``_handle_finish_task`` → ``_validate_finish_args`` — checks the same schema and
does strictly more (duplicate-submission detection, verdict narration, io hoist),
and both rules the deleted gate's tests pinned are pinned there too:
``test_cognitive_flow.py::TestFinishTask::test_finish_rejects_schema_validation_errors``
and ``::test_finish_without_schema_raises_phase_2_a1``.
