"""The middleware chain's order is a contract, and this pins it.

Re-ordering the chain silently is the latent bug class the fixed order exists to
make impossible, and 2026-08-20 showed what that bug looks like when nothing
catches it: with tracing sitting BELOW the middlewares that answer tool calls
themselves, `ToolCallStartedEvent` was emitted zero times in a real run while
every layer above it — the type, the export, the frontend mirror, the trace
renderer — looked perfectly wired.

The order is stated once, in `MVP0_MIDDLEWARE_ORDER_CONTRACT`. There used to be a
second statement of the same fact (`DEFAULT_MIDDLEWARE_ORDER`, a three-class
tuple asserted to equal the contract's first three), and it is gone: one fact
described in two places is a fact that can disagree with itself, and this move
is precisely the edit that would have made it disagree.
